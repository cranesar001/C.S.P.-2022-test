<p3><br>Basenji are great family pets, and like being around people. They are small in size, weighting around 22-24 pound, and have very short fur so they don't shead very much. 
These dogs are a bit energetic, but because of their small size, only one hour of exercise is recommendeda day. 
Basenji are a barkless dog, but have a very distinct yodel instead.</p3>
