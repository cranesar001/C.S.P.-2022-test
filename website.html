<p3>Starting out at number one is the Basenji</p3>
<a href="Basenji_dog_pic.jpg"><img src="Basenji_dog_pic.jpg"></a>
<p3>Basenji are great family pets, and like being around people. They are small in size, weighting around 22-24 pound, and have very short fur so they don't shead very much. 
These dogs are a bit energetic, but because of their small size, only one hour of exercise is recommendeda day. 
Basenji are a barkless dog, but have a very distinct yodel instead.</p3>
