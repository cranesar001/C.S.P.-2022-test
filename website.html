<p2><br>Firstly, lets start with some dogs for a new pet owner, that are easier to take care of.</p2>
<p3>Starting out at number one is the Basenji.</p3>
    
<p3><br>Basenji are great family pets, and like being around people. They are small in size, weighting around 22-24 pound, and have very short fur so they don't shead very much. 
These dogs are a bit energetic, but because of their small size, only one hour of exercise is recommendeda day. 
Basenji are a barkless dog, but have a very distinct yodel instead.</p3>
  
  <p2><br>Another great dog is the Dachshund.</p2>

  <p3><br>Dachshund are small dogs with their distinct short legs and long body. Although this dogs are small they are very smart and joyful. They are
  often very cursious and have the tnedency the bark at almost anything that picks thier intrest. Dachshunds are moderate shedders, but are great family pets. 
  They are also hypoallergenic so they are less likely to cause allergic reactions.</p3>
