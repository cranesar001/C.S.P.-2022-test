 <h1>Dogs For You</h1>
<p2>Are you looking to adopt a new dog, but you don't know which breed would be the best for you?<br>
My website will give you some recommendations for dogs more suitable for new owners.</p2>

<p2><br>First and foremost, let's talk about some dogs for a new pet owner that is easier to care for and have as a companion.</p2>
<br><br><p3>Starting at number one is the Basenji.</p3>
  
    <br><a href="Basenji_dog_pic.jpg"><img src="Basenji_dog_pic.jpg" width="300" height="300"></a>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Weight: 22-24 pounds
        <li>Average size: 15-17 inches
          <li>Life span: 12-16 years
          <li>Common colors: Chestnut red, pure black, tricolor, or brindle
  </ul>
  
<p3><br>Basenjis are great family pets and like being around people. These dogs have short fur, so they don't shed very much, but they groom themselves,
meaning they don't have the typical dog smell. 
<br>These dogs are a bit energetic, but because of their medium size, only one hour of exercise is recommended. 
Basenji can not physically bark but can growl or make a very distinct yodel instead, but they are often quieter.</p3>
  
  <br><br><p2><br>Another great dog are Dachshunds.</p2>
  
  <br><a href="sable-long-hair-dachshund-780x536.jpg"><img src="sable-long-hair-dachshund-780x536.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Weight: 16-32 pounds
      <li>Average size: Standing hight of 33-37 inches
        <li>Life span: 12-16 years
          <li>Common colors: Black, tan, cream, red, or mulitcolored
  </ul>
                                                                                                                          
  <p3><br> Dachshunds are small dogs with distinct short legs and long bodies. They come in 2 different sizes including a normal and miniature size and<br>have 3 different coat textures. 
    These tiny dogs are clever, joyful, and curious, and have the tendency to bark at almost anything that picks their interest. Dachshunds are moderate shedders but are great family pets. 
   <br>They are also hypoallergenic so they are less likely to cause allergic reactions in people.</p3>
  
  <br><br><p3>Alternatively, Greyhounds are another great and easy dog to take care.</p3>

  <ul>
    <li>Weight: 60-88 pounds
      <li>Average size: 68-76 inches
        <li>Life span: 10-14 years
          <li>Common colors: Brindle, red, or white
  
  <br><p3>Greyhounds are very gentle, affectionate, playful, and noble dogs. These dogs are the fastest animal in the world (other than a cheetah),
   so they enjoy outings but need little exercise time. Their short, smooth coats mean they shed very little, requiring only the occasional brush. 
   Greyhounds are naturally well-mannered, but that doesn't mean training comes naturally, too.</p3>
  
  <br><br><p4>I made this page not only to give people information about some dog breeds but to emphasize the importance of research and preparation before getting a dog. 
  <br>Dogs are living beings and need almost as much attention as a human. So please don't get a dog if you can not provide for their needs. But if you have done your research and 
    are ready for a new dog, <br>below are some links to adoption centers that have plenty of dogs and other animals that need a home.</p4>
